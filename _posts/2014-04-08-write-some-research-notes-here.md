I found the github and the github.io are very powerful these days, with github I can manage codes with git and download many useful opensource codes, while in github.io I can write some research notes here to share with others.

##Domain
I have a main domain and blog powered by google blogger which I use to record my thoughts about the daily life in Chinese language. I don't want to mix the research blog and life blog, so I build a sub domain here. Meanwhile, the markdown language supported by Jekyll is very suitable for write some research notes.

##Theme 
I use the very clear and beautiful theme [lagom-orange](http://github.com/james12802/lagom-orange), thanks for the author [james12802](http://james12802.co.uk/) and [Matt Swanson](http://www.mdswanson.com/). 

##Comment
The Disqus is very good, it is also used in my Chinese blog.

##Math Equation
Mathjax, of course, is the first choice.  For example the root of equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is :
$$ x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

##Code piece
Here is a piece of code in c:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

##Language
Maybe I can try write English blog here.
